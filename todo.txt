TODO:

Rotated Rectangle Collision System
==================================

The game is current using an AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding-Box) collision
system. This means the bounding box for game entities is are fixed
rectangles. While simple, this system is not ideal. A ideal collision
system which detects rotated rectangles is needed for features like
homing missiles and enemies that can fly and shoot at an angle.

The way the collision is implemented right now is:
Every collidable game entity has a bounding box (currently an SDL_Rect)
that the system uses to detect collisions.

This should not be an SDL_Rect, but instead a data structure of a
rectangle along with an angle, used to model the shape of the object.
The system should change the detection algorithm to accomodate this by
implementing the "Seperating Axis Theorem" algorithm described in the
links below.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Changing states too quickly may cause game to freeze up. Most likely to
occur when changing to/from the MenuState.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Entering GameMenu state while moving will and going back into GameState
causes player to move indefinitely in the direction of movement until
a movement key is pressed.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

On some keyboards, simultaneously pressing the left and down arrow keys
while shooting will not cause player to move diagonally as expected.
This does not occur when using the wasd movement keys.

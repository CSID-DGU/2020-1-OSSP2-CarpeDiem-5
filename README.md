NOTE: This project is currently on hold because I want to explore other
areas of programming. I may or may not come back to this specific project,
but I will definitely be coming back to game development in the future. As
of the time of writing, the game is playable wth one level and a boss fight.

sdl-space-shooter
=================
(last updated README.md on June 22, 2015)

A 2D space shooter named... Space Shooter...

Currently supported on Linux and Windows. An OS X build is planned for the
future.

Due to copyright issues, the music I used will not be included. If you want
to use your own music, create the directory "data/audio/music" and put your
music in there. The file extention must be ".ogg".

The following audio file names will correspond to the state it will be played
in:

- Menu State: menu.ogg
- Game State: level1.ogg
- Boss Fight: boss.ogg
- Victory State: win.ogg
- Game Over State: lose.ogg

Language
=================

This application is written in C++ using the SDL2 library. C++ was the
language of choice because it is the de facto standard in the gaming
industry. The game engine is rolled by hand, because this project was
originally done as a learning exercise on software architeture and to learn
about game engines. This is also the reason why an off the shelf game
engine like Unity was not used.


Motivation
=================

As previously mentioned, this project was originally done as a learning
exercise. However, these goals have evolved into creating a complete open
source game that is polished enough to ship. This means, that the
envisioned final product will be cross platform and will feature:

- smooth menu transitions
- customizable levels/enemies (currently through XML, but will eventually
want to have an embedded lua scripting environment for enemy behaviour)
- co-operative mode
- more as seen fit
